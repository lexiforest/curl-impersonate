## Installation
There are two versions of `curl-impersonate` for technical reasons. The **chrome** version is used to impersonate Chrome, Edge and Safari.

### Pre-compiled binaries
Pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available at the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl-impersonate/releases) page. Before you use them you may need to install zstd and CA certificates:

* Ubuntu - `sudo apt install ca-certificates zstd libzstd-dev`
* Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS - `yum install ca-certificates zstd libzstd-devel`
* Archlinux - `pacman -S ca-certificates zstd`
* macOS - `brew install ca-certificates zstd`

The pre-compiled binaries contain libcurl-impersonate and a statically compiled curl-impersonate for ease of use.

The pre-compiled Linux binaries are built for Ubuntu systems. On other distributions if you have errors with certificate verification you may have to tell curl where to find the CA certificates. For example:

    curl_chrome123 https://www.wikipedia.org --cacert /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

Also make sure to read [Notes on Dependencies](#notes-on-dependencies).
